## Questions

1. What does ***inheritance*** accomplish for us in C#?

Inheritance allows us to use sections of code within other sections where the parent code has access to the child code that is embedded within it.

2. How does ***member inheritance*** work in C#? Does a `Class` inherit all members of the base `Class`?

Member inheritance works that only certain things are inherited by the parent class. For instance constructors are not inherited by other classes.

3. How does ***accessibility*** affect inheritance?

Accessibility can help to make it so parent classes can inherit some of the things listed on constructors and other parts of a class that are not necessarily accessible.
