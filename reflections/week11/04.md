## Questions

Review and reflect on your experiences in this course, as this is the last lecture before your **final project**. What are your concerns? How do you plan to manage your time? What have you enjoyed most about the course up to this point?

I've really loved getting to know more and more people in the industry. I enjoy working on the front end of projects the most and I find that I really enjoy the logic behind coding. I think for the final I am really going to try to parse out my time so that I am making sure I stay on track.
