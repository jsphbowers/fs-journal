## Questions

1. What technologies and principles are you using in your project?

We are utilizing a lot of vue and our knowledge about how to access APIs and get information. It has been really cool seeing all of our knowledge coming together.

2. What went well so far?

So far our structure has been really good and our workflow has gone really well. We have been getting a lot of progress and we have even reached a lot of our feature rich goals which has been awesome.

3. What would you do differently? Why?

Honestly, not much. Working on our Trello and utilizing it more I think that might help a lot as far as planning and coming up with more ideas to use on the project.
