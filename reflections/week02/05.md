# Weekly Reflection
This reflection is open-format, so it can be whatever you like. Take this opportunity to write a bit on some of the things you have learned this week or some of the things that you are still struggling with; identify some challenges you had at the beginning of the week that you were able to overcome, or just generally reflect on how you are feeling at this point in the course.


## Prompts
- What went well this week?
- What did you learn that was a shock or surprise?
- What are you struggling with?
- What would you count as a victory?


I think this week went pretty well overall. I think it was helpful having been exposed to and struggled with javascript before the course with the pre-work. This has made me nervous for the weeks ahead as we will now be getting into concepts that I have never been exposed to.

I think writing functions and the logic of making hte functions is pretty clear to me. I do think that querys and how and when to use them was a little bit lost on me as I did not really see the benefit to generating them but it might have been that I did not have the right code in my project to make much use of them.
