- What are you struggling with?
- What would you count as a victory?


This week was HACKATHON! which was a ton of fun! It was cool seeing what its like to work in a group. While you have a lot more brains and eyes working on the same project which can be helpful it also can make things feel like they're moving a lot slower. We ultimately got a lot done with the project which was awesome and it was fun all coming together to finish something.
