## Questions

1. In simple terms what is ***timeboxing***?

Timeboxing is taking tasks or breaking a project down into tasks and then allotting specific time to work on those tasks where you have a box of time to complete them and you commit to keeping the time you work on them within that timeframe trying not to go over or under that alloted time.

2. What three strategies will you implement and how?

I think i might try using the 2 minute timing strategy to help me understand just what I can get done in 2 minutes. I think it could be really helpful

I am going to try using the pomodoro method for working on tasks. I think 25 minutes is really a good window for working on projects and it helps to reinforce the taking breaks principle. I got the focus booster app to see if it helps me.

I want to try implementing this strategy with projects I want to get done around the house. I am good at making myself a todo list for when I have free time to get things done but it has become harder to stick to that list when I have not alloted time to work on some of those projects.

3. Give an example of when you would have benefitted from timeboxing and how? 

I think breaking down larger projects in school especially college would have helped me to understand just how much time I had and when I needed to be using it.
