## Questions

1. What is the purpose of a ***query string***?

A query sting is used to append information to the end of a URL which in turn will pass the query to the server that we are talking to.

2. What is the format of a ***query parameter***? How does it start? How do you distinguish between one parameter and the next?

A query parameter starts by adding a '?'to the end of a url and then parameters are listed as a=1 or this=anotherobject, if we want to append multiple queries we can put a '&' between them to link them together. like ?a=1&this=anotherobject

3. When do you think query parameters would be helpful when writing your server?

Query parameters would be helpful for guiding users to certain pages of information or passing information to the server for storage.
