## Questions

1. In a SQL table, what is the difference between information in a row and information in a column?

Information in a row can be considered a single object or an instance of a unit of data that has been added to a table. The column is an identifier/a filter that can be used to pull multiple objects from a table.

2. Demonstrate the basic structure for creating a new table called "characters" with the values "name, age, description" as strings, and an `int` id.

CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS characters (
  id INT NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT COMMENT 'primary key'
  name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL
  age SMALLINT NOT NULL
  description VARCHAR(600) NOT NULL
)

3. What are the difference between the following statements: 
```sql
DELETE FROM table_name; - this function will remove a row from the table and delete it.
DROP TABLE table_name; - this will drop/delete the entire table out of the database removing everything.
```
