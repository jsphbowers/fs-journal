# Weekly Reflection
This reflection is open-format, so it can be whatever you like. Take this opportunity to write a bit on some of the things you have learned this week or some of the things that you are still struggling with; identify some challenges you had at the beginning of the week that you were able to overcome, or just generally reflect on how you are feeling at this point in the course.

## Prompts
- What went well this week?
- What did you learn that was a shock or surprise?
- What are you struggling with?
- What would you count as a victory?


Vue was intimidating at the beginning of the week but by the time we reached the checkpoint I felt I had a much better handle on how it worked. I've found that I have struggled with keeping up on the journals and quizzes so I want to try to do a better job of staying on top of it next week.
