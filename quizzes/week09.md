```
**4.** What is the `Strategy` design pattern?
<!-- enter you answer in the space below -->
```
The Strategy design is used when there are multiple paths to take and we let the client application decide which path to use in each instance so the computer can choose the best path.
```
**5.** What is the `Factory` design pattern?
<!-- enter you answer in the space below -->
```
The Factory design pattern is used when you have a superclass that has multiple subclasses and the application uses the superclass to call up different subclasses which are then implemented.
```
**6.** What is test driven development?
<!-- enter you answer in the space below -->
```
The test driven development or (TDD) is a method where programmers break down projects into smaller units where the goal is to finish a unit and test it before moving onto the next one. This helps to finish the functionality of the code before moving on.

```
**8.** Give two examples of a user story:
<!-- enter you answer in the space below -->
```
A user logs into the app and then selects the edit profile page, the page should populate and then allow the user to see all the details of their profile, from here they should see an edit button or a method for them to be able to edit their profile form this page.

A user clicks the image of a video on the website. The video should then populate and take up a large space of the screen giving the user a centered area of attention. There should be options on the video to adjust size and playback, maybe even captions. If the user clicks off the video the video should stop playing and it should return them to the home page.
```
